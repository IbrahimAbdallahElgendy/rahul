abstract: "10G-passive optical network (XG-PON) provides an emerging potential technology to carry multiple services for the first - mile access network. However, it offers 0.3 ms propagation delay between the optical network Unit (ONU) and optical line terminal (OLT) resulting in inevitable increased queuing delay for the bandwidth grants to the ONUs. We present a reasonable and effective uplink dynamic bandwidth allocation method - demand forecasting DBA (DF-DBA) that predicts ONU’s future demands by statistical modelling of the demand patterns and tends to fulfil the predicted demands just in time, which results in reduced delay. Results show that use of simple normal distribution in the DBA engine offers more appropriate bandwidth allocation with 14% decreased packet drop ratio (PDR) values than standard GigaPON access network (GIANT) DBA following request-grant cycle procedure.
