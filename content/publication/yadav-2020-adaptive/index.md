abstract: "In this paper, we address the problems of massive amount of energy consumption and service level agreements (SLAs) violation in cloud environment. Although most of the existing work proposed solutions regarding energy consumption and SLA violation for cloud data centers (CDCs), while ignoring some important factor: 
(1) analysing the robustness of upper CPU utilization threshold which maximize utilization of resources; (2) CPU utilization prediction based VM selection from overloaded host which reduce performance degradation time and SLA violation.
