summary: " Today’s vehicles are not standalone mechanical means of transportation, rather also have some form of computing and communication capabilities. These capabilities are being advanced and powerful day-by-day enabled via the growing number of embedded system components attached towards intelligent automation of vehicles. Thus, the vehicles can be considered as on the move computing systems. Towards this end, in this project, we propose an innovative idea “Big Traffic Data-centric Vehicular Fog Computing Framework for Smart Cities”. Basically, the idea is to harness the computing capability of a geographically close group of vehicles such as at parking space near offices, shopping centres, train stations, residential areas, and at on-road junction points (see below Figure, vehicular fogs or fog banks (FB))."
