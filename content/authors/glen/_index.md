 Professor Yu-Chu Tian  received the Ph.D. degree in computer and software engineering from the University of Sydney, Sydney NSW, Australia, in 2009 and the Ph.D. degree in industrial automation from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1993. He is currently a Professor with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane QLD, Australia. His research interests include big data computing, distributed computing, cloud computing, real-time computing, computer networks and communications, optimization, and control systems. The areas of applications of his research include power systems, hospitals, medical big data, and transport systems.

 

Professor Tian is the Editor-in-Chief for Handbook of Real-Time Computing, a book series of major reference works published by Springer. As an Associate Editor, he is serving the journal of Information Sciences published by Elsevier and Asia-Pacific Journal of Chemical Engineering published by Wiley. He is an ACM Reviewer for Computing Reviews. He is also acting as a Reviewer for a number of international journals. He is a technology provider to several Australian companies for big data computing, cloud computing, networks and communications, complex systems engineering, real-time/embedded systems, and intelligent systems. Dr Tian is currently supervising 7 PhD/Masters students and several postdoc/visiting research fellows.

 

Professor Tian joined the Naval Academy of Engineering, China, in 1987, as a Lecturer in systems engineering. From 1994 to 1998, he worked at the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Industrial Process Control, Zhejiang University, China, where he was promoted to Associate Professor in Electrical Engineering in 1995. From 1996 to 1998, he was on leave from Zhejiang University to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, as a Research Associate working on complex systems and process control. He moved to Australia in 1998, working as a Research Fellow at Curtin University of Technology. In 1999, he was elected as one of the four Western Australia Strategic Research Fellows. Since 2002, he has been working at Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, initially as a Lecturer, later as a Senior Lecturer, the Networking Teaching Group Leader, Associate Professor in Computer Science, the Leader of the Networks and Communications Discipline, and currently as a Professor of Computer Science. He also worked as a visiting professor at the Department of Computer Science, the University of Maryland at College Park, USA, in 2007.

 

As the Chief Investigator, Professor Tian has won/completed over 20 research grants/projects, including 6 funded by Australian Research Council (ARC), 3 funded by Australian Cooperative Research Centre (CRC), 1 funded by Australian Government Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST), and 1 funded by ATN-DAAD (Australian-Germany Collaborative Project Grant). He holds a patent on real-time control of large-scale and continuous galvanising line. Prof Tian has published a monograph (by World Scientific Publishing Co.). He has credited over 200 refereed papers in his publication record, including over 140 indexed by SCI. His publications have been cited over 3400 times in Google Scholar Citations with the h-index of 30.
