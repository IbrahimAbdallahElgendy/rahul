title: "Special Issue: Edge and Fog Computing"
subtitle: "SI in Hindawi, WCMC Journal"
summary: "Fog/edge computing enables IoT applications to improve the scalability and energy efficiency of IoT systems, exploit computational node resources to analyse the collected data, and meet latency requirements. Nevertheless, a series of challenging problems need to be addressed in order to fully utilize fog/edge computing for IoT. For instance, the majority of computational nodes in fog/edge computing are battery-operated, which means that fog/edge computing tends to be unreliable. Moreover, efficiently providing computing resources to latency-sensitive IoT applications (such as AR/VR, haptic technology, intelligent manufacturing, connected autonomous driving, and others), and seamless integration of fog/edge computing with cloud computing to provide scalable services needs to be further studied."
